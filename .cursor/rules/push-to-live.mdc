# Push to Live Site After Edits

When the user asks for a change or feature in this project, after completing the edits:

1. **Stage and commit** all changed files with a clear message (e.g. "Header blue", "Add X feature").
2. **Push** to the remote so the live site (GitHub Pages) updates.

Use the project root: `I:\My Drive\Cursor Apps\Team Week Schedule` (or the workspace path for this repo). Commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
git push
```

Only push when the user has requested a change and edits were made. Do not push on purely informational or read-only requests.
