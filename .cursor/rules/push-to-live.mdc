# Hard Rule: Push After Every Change

**This is mandatory.** For any change the user asks you to do in this project:

1. **After completing the edits**, you must:
   - Stage all changed files (`git add` for the modified files, or `git add .`).
   - Commit with a clear message describing the change.
   - Push to the remote (`git push`).

2. **No exceptions.** Do not finish a task without pushing. Even small fixes or single-file edits must be committed and pushed.

3. **Commands** (use project root: `I:\My Drive\Cursor Apps\Team Week Schedule`; on Windows PowerShell use `;` instead of `&&`):
   - `git add .` (or specific files)
   - `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`
   - `git push`

Always push everything afterwards so the live site (e.g. GitHub Pages) stays in sync.
